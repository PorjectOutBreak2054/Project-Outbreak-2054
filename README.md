# Project Outbreak 2054

## Welcome to Project Outbreak 2054

The year is **2054**, and the truth is buried on a series of stolen hard drives—each one holding explosive secrets taken from the **MINISTRY OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND OPERATIONS (MSDO)**.

**We have one drive** in our possession, but there are **more out there**, scattered across the world, waiting to be uncovered. This is where you come in. We need **your help** to find the rest of the stolen drives and expose the dark truths hidden within them. Time is of the essence—the **MSDO** is actively hunting for these drives, and they’ll stop at nothing to recover them.

**Your mission** is simple: Use our custom-built program to analyze the stolen drive we have, and help us track down the others.

## The Story So Far...

After years of secrecy, the **MINISTRY OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND OPERATIONS (MSDO)** stored its most classified files on a series of hard drives—data that could expose covert operations, manipulation of world events, and global surveillance programs. 

These drives were **stolen by a rogue faction** within the MSDO and hidden across various locations. The one drive we currently hold contains a fraction of the information, but **we know there are more** out there.

The **MSDO is actively searching** for the stolen drives. They know what’s at stake, and they’ll do everything in their power to prevent the truth from coming out.

## Your Mission

We have **one stolen drive**, but we need your help to find the others. Here’s what you need to do:

### 1. **Analyze the Drive We Have**
Start by using the program we’ve developed to analyze the stolen drive in our possession. **Run the program** to decrypt the files, uncover hidden messages, and reveal the secrets within. Each file is a piece of the puzzle—what we find here could be the key to locating the remaining drives.

### 2. **Help Us Find the Other Drives**
We know the drives are out there, scattered in different locations, possibly hidden in plain sight. Using the data we uncover from the first drive, we can start looking for clues that may lead us to the others. **Every discovery helps us get closer**. Whether it’s a hidden address, a coded message, or an artifact tied to the MSDO, we need you to keep your eyes open for anything that could lead to the rest of the drives.

### 3. **Collaborate with the Community**
This is a team effort. Share your findings with others on the [Discord/Forum]. **The more eyes on the data, the faster we can solve this puzzle**. The community is key—work together to piece together the larger mystery, track down the missing drives, and expose what the MSDO is hiding.

### 4. **Decrypt Files and Solve Puzzles**
As you dig deeper into the drive we currently hold, you’ll encounter encrypted files, fragmented data, and hidden messages. Some clues may lead you to other drives. **Use the program** to decrypt files, analyze data, and look for patterns that can point to new locations where the missing drives may be. The program also has built-in tools to help you recover damaged files and solve complex riddles.
